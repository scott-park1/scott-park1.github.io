      <h1 id="Learning">Foundations Reflection</h1>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What are three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">I found out that I lack empathy towards others from the core learning. When doing the listening and looping practise, it was very difficult for me to loop over what others said and most of the times, I needed help from them to loop back. Following on from empathy, I also found out that I lean more towards IQ than EQ. It is not like I am a highly intelligent person but I am not an emotionally expressive person. I tend to prioritise logic and reason over emotions and feelings. Last new thing that I found about myself is that I tend to slack off when I feeling unmotivated. When I face challenges and difficulties during the exercises, I get out of focus and tends to lack my work. I would need to keep practising to stay focused and stay on my work even if I encounter obstacles. This will help me improve my productivity which is a first step towards developing better habits.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Values play an important role in learning and programming because they help to guide decision-making and establish priorities. Having a strong sense of values can help a programmer to stay confident and stick to their goals and finish the work efficiently. Empathy also plays an important role in programming because it allows programmers to understand the needs and perspectives of their users. Empathy helps programmers to work more effectively with others on a team as it enables them to communicate and resolve the issue. Self-awareness is a key in programming because it allows programmers to acknowledge their own strengths and weaknesses. Programmers who are aware of their limitations can use their skills and improve their skills.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">During the core learning, I found out that people with higher EQ level than IQ level are more successful in their careers and this was the most surprising part. I always thought IQ is more important because as we grow up, we learn and study, and the people with higher intelligence knowledge tend to succeed. However, after studying about EQ and IQ, I found that it was the other way around. It is not like that people with higher IQ will not succeed, I think it was more people with higher EQ will have more chance to succeed.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">The most challenging aspects of the core learning was the practising part that I learned from it. It could be the skills and the mindset that I did not have in the past, and it was very difficult to apply straight away when I was working on the exercises.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">Why do I think, a programming school, spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Bootcamp course will be more intense than the course in the Foundation and to prepare for this, it was important for us to study the core learning in a web development. The practical part of coding is also important but in order to get through the Bootcamp course, we had to learn and find out what our strengths and weaknesses were, our learning plan, and what human skills we needed to strive for.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">Does the time I spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h2>
      <p id="AnswersLast">At first, I thought what is so good about studying the core learning and what good does it have on me. I wanted to study and practise more programming because that would get me through the course. However, after studying about core learning, I learned so many things which helped me to get my head around when I faced challenges and difficulties during the Foundation course. If I continue use the skills that I learned in the core learning, I would be able to go through the Bootcamp just like I did in the Foundation.</p>
