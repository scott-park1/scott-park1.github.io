      <h1 id="Learning">About Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Emotional Intelligence (also known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to manage your emotions and understand the emotions of people around you. In other words, it is the ability to demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use emotions to communicate effectively, emphasise with others, and overcome any challenges and difficulties. Emotional intelligence is commonly defined by four attributes: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.</p>

      <h2 id="Questions">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">If EQ is more of the emotional ability side, we can say that IQ (Intelligence Quotient) is more of the logical ability to learn, understand and implement knowledge to skills. It shows how successful we can be with challenging tasks and to be able to analyse and connect the dots. IQ is a score derived from one of several standardised tests designed to assess intelligence. Some similarities between them are that they can be measured by taking a test and, they both can be improved or strengthened in lots of different ways.</p>

      <h2 id="Questions">Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">The IQ and EQ level are different in different persons. It is possible that a person has a high IQ level, but low EQ level and vice versa. The important fact is that many people say, and the researches significantly show that the people with higher EQ than IQ are more successful in their careers. So, if there were two types of persons, one with high IQ level but low EQ level and another with low IQ and high EQ, the hiring manager will choose the second type of person due to their ability to understand, emphasise, and to be able to connect with people around them. EQ is a better indicator to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves. </p>
      <p id="AnswersLast">Afterall, we all need to work at some point and it is important for us to find a job that builds satisfying relationships, be emotionally connected with the people, and to be able to handle stress at the workplace. This way will help us to bring more happiness and joy to our lives.</p>
