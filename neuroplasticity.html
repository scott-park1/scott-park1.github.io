      <h1 id="Learning">What is Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset?</h1>
      <h2 id="QuestionsNeuro">"Neuroplasticity"</h2>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to reorganise itself by forming new neural connections throughout a person’s life. To understand better, we break into two parts. Plasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change. Neuro refers to neurons, the nerve cells that are the building blocks of the brain and nervous system. Thus, we can say that neuroplasticity allows nerve cells to change or adjust.</p>
      <p id="Answers">There are two types of neuroplasticity: Functional plasticity is the brain’s ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to undamaged areas. Structural plasticity is the brain’s ability to change it physical structure as a result of learning.</p>
      <p id="Answers">There are many benefits of brain neuroplasticity but here are the main ones:</p>
      <p id="Positive">-The ability to learn new things;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-The ability to recover from stokes and traumatic brain injuries;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Strengthen areas where function is lost;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Improvements that can boost brain fitness.</p>
      <p id="Answers">It seems like young brains tend to be more sensitive and responsive to experiences than much older brains in general. However, this does not mean that adult brains are not capable of adaptation. Many people believed that the brain becomes fixed after a certain age but the recent researches significantly show that the brain never stops changing in response to learning.</p>

      <h2 id="Question">How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">After studying about neuroplasticity, there could be lots of benefits I can take into myself. The two main principles I can engage into are repetition and intensity. A repeated practice of a skill or an intense activity can lead to long-term changes in the brain and help strengthen neural connections. So, if I keep practicing how to code and do lots of challenging activities online, it will surely help me to be more confident in the future.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">What are some of the ways to increase my neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">There are many ways to increase neuroplasticity and for myself, I can try:</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Learn a new language;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Learn how to play an instrument;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Travel and explore new places;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-Read a book.</p>
      <p id="Answers">Previously, I have done a lot of things to increase my neuroplasticity. For example, I learned lots of languages like English (second language), Japanese, Chinese, and Māori during high school and at university. I also learned how to play instruments like playing drums, violin, and piano.</p>

      <h2 id="QuestionsNeuro">"Growth Mindset"</h2>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">A growth mindset is defined as one’s abilities that can be developed and improved through hard work, dedication, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. It is relevant because it can have a significant impact on an individual’s personal and professional success. Encouraging a growth mindset can help individuals to approach challenges with a positive attitude, to view failures as learning opportunities, and to continuously strive for improvement.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">Did anything surprise me or change for me in this exploration?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">I already mentioned in my Learning Plan blog that I want to strive for a growth mindset so nothing has surprised me or changed.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Most of my life, I lived with a fixed mindset where I tried to avoid challenges, mistakes, and failures, and I did not take any risks or tried out new things. However, in order to strive for a growth mindset, I would need to continue seek through improvements for myself. This could be encouraging myself to learn from mistakes and keep the same positive attitude and motivation throughout the whole course.</p>

      <h2 id="QuestionsNeuro">"Blend with my learning plan and strategies"</h2>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">How would these understandings may shape or influence my learning plan and strategy?</h2>
      <p id="AnswersLast">After studying about neuroplasticity and a growth mindset, I took into myself that learning new things, taking in new ways, and with more exploration, it will help me to further take on new challenges and obstacles. When it comes to my learning plan, I should be able to take risks and not be afraid of making mistakes, in which I can learn more from what I did wrong. Previously, I always wanted to stick to what I am familiar with, that came from my experiences. However, in some cases, it will be good to try out new things, in a new way so that I would have both opportunities to learn and develop myself which will help me to lead onto a successful career and life.</p>
