    <h1 id="Learning">My Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p id="Answers">I want to develop, learn new things so that I could find some improvements for myself and have a successful career. In order to do that, I would need to study hard, learn as much as I could, and become a good developer with good coding skills in hand.</p>
    <p id="Answers">After getting a job, I want to get competent in the role as soon as possible. Once I am trained up in the role to a good standard, I would like to consolidate my skills and become experienced within the team. It is very important to me to be accepted and respected by my work colleagues and peers. So, I guess the short answer is that I want to become good at my job, be accepted by my team and line managers and enjoy my work as much as possible.</p>
    <p id="Answers">My biggest dream or long-term goal is to be able to take care of my family financially and physically. My parents, when I grew up, they took care of me and supported me in lots of different ways to give me a good life. I want to pay them back, I want to take care of them and just help whenever they need.</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
    <p id="Answers">I have many positive qualities and attributes, but I believe my main key strengths are:</p>
    <p id="Positive">-I have a hard-working nature;</p>
    <p id="Positive">-I have an excellent communication skill;</p>
    <p id="Positive">-I am always looking for the positives in every situation;</p>
    <p id="Positive">-I am a great team player.</p>
    <p id="Answers">One other quality is that I am always looking for ways to improve the way I perform so I can work to the highest standards possible in my role.</p>
    <p id="Answers">I believe all these qualities will help me get through well when it comes to learning. If I was to choose one quality, I would choose to look for positives in every situation and that will be the key to help me to learn as much as I could. I assume there will be some stress as I learn, and I think it is good to have a positive mindset so that I can try to look to find ways to resolve the issue as fast as possible.</p>
    <p id="Answers">I do struggle sometimes, and that is I sometimes get slightly irritated when I use a lot of my time to understand when I do not get the concept. Using a lot of time to understand something can be a good habit but it also means that I will get pressured and will not have a lot of time to finish my other works. Also, because I am a bit introverted and quiet most of the times, I like to be alone and do things by myself. This can cause a lot of problems, like for example, I might try solve the problem by myself even if it takes a lot of time, and might not be brave enough to ask questions to others. I think it will be good to raise a hand to someone for help but when I think about my personality, I am not the person who really does that and might cause some stress when it comes to learning.</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p id="Answers">There are many human skills that workers need to thrive in todayâ€™s rapidly evolving organisations and the two most human skills that I want to see a development in myself are empathy and a growth mindset. I want to be able to and further develop myself to understand and share the feelings of one another. Most of the times, I rely on the fact and what the issue is but not looking at what the others are going through, what their thoughts are, and what feelings they have. In order to change my view, I guess I would need to keep thinking about others and have a caring mindset so when there is a problem, I will be able to understand and share my feelings as well as listening to theirs. With growth mindset, I did mention in my strengths part above that I want to keep improving myself and just adding to that, I want to continually think to myself that my position is not safe. I need to evolve and further train myself to learn more and I think that will lead to a solid growth mindset.</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h2>
    <p id="Answers">Time management and organisational skills are what I need in order to manage my workload in this programme. I would need to use my time well to plan out what I need to do now and what to do in the future when things start building up and for me to be able to work productively. Using a calendar or a Toggl tool to write down what I need to do exactly in that week or even each day and trying to keep my time using that application would be very important. I think it is also important to go over the topics for that week and see if I missed out on anything and to revise again for future use so that I fully understand before moving onto the next topic. It will be good to revise for the topics I will cover in the upcoming weeks just so that I have an idea what will come up and not be surprised when I get stuck.</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
    <p id="Answers">It will be good to think ahead the appropriate tools I need to use when I need to seek for help, just so that I will not panic if something goes wrong. Tools could be for example, using the Dev Academy discord channel, Google, and YouTube. If I get stuck on something, I will try look for information online. After about 20 to 30 minutes to resolve the problem myself, and if I am still confused, I will try ask people around in the discord channel.</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">A description of what I expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
    <p id="Answers">The facilitation team has been wonderful so far in my learning journey here at Dev Academy. There is nothing to add more but if I was to give my expectations from the team, it would be kindness and support. It will get intense and busier as we learn more, and it would great if the team could help me out whenever they can. The team has been very supportive already!</p>
    <h2 id="Questions">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when I am committed to other things.</h2>
    <p id="AnswersLast">I have a dog called Charlie (a dachshund breed), and he recently got a surgery on his back because of a disc problem. Because he cannot walk yet, I need to take him out (physically hold him up and carry) when he needs to go out for toilet. It would probably take about few minutes.</p>
