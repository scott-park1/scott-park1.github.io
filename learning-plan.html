      <h2 id="QuestionsNeuro">"Bootcamp Learning Plan"</h2>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">My long-term goal and my career pathway would be the same that I mentioned previously in my Learning Plan (see below). With the skills I learned in Foundations and the skills that I will learn during Bootcamp, I would like to seek for a job in a technology based company and continue my career from there.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">My biggest strengths and limitations for the Bootcamp would be the same that I mentioned previously in my Learning Plan (see below). What I need to work on more is to ask questions frequently in Bootcamp when I need to reach out for help and to finish my tasks in the given time.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be to stay on top of the material and keeping focused for nine weeks. It will get more intense during the Bootcamp and there will be more workload compared to Foundations. I would like stay committed and focused because when I face difficulties, I tend to slack and lose focus. To resolve this, I would need to be very organised and plan out my week ahead which will help me to finish my tasks before the deadline and be prepared for the next one.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What non-technical skills and human skills would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">There could be many non-technical skills and human skills I would like to develop myself while at Dev Academy, but the main human skill I would like to keep improving on is empathy. As for myself, I tend to prioritise logic and reason over emotions and feelings and I know that in Bootcamp there will be more chances of working in a pair and in a group. In order to work and lead the group to success, I would need work on expressing my feelings and opinions to others as well as listening and understanding theirs. It will be hard, there could be many conflicts and it will be important to respect others and stay positive with each other.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What are my expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">My expectations from the Bootcamp team are to provide clear instructions and guidelines, access to quality learning resources, prompt feedback and support, and a supportive and inclusive learning environment. Going in deeper, in terms of support, this could include: a technical support, mentorship, career guidance, and emotional support. I would want to expect the Bootcamp team to communicate regularly and be available to answer my questions and address the issue. So far in my learning journey at Dev Academy, the team, the facilitators were all very supportive so I have no problem on the Bootcamp as well.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p id="AnswersLast">My expectation of myself on Bootcamp is to stay focused, stay positive in any way, and to be organised so that I can commit my learning and engage in the Bootcamp’s resources to succeed. To manage the workload effectively, I would need to prioritise my tasks, set realistic goals, and establish a study routine. This way will help me to maintain a work-life balance and avoid stress. To work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives, I would need to be respectful of others’ opinions and communicate clearly and professionally when working as an individual or in a team.</p>
      <h2 id="QuestionsNeuro">"Foundations Learning Plan"</h2>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">What is my long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">I want to develop, learn new things so that I could find some improvements for myself and have a successful career. In order to do that, I would need to study hard, learn as much as I could, and become a good developer with good coding skills in hand.</p>
      <p id="Answers">After getting a job, I want to get competent in the role as soon as possible. Once I am trained up in the role to a good standard, I would like to consolidate my skills and become experienced within the team. It is very important to me to be accepted and respected by my work colleagues and peers. So, I guess the short answer is that I want to become good at my job, be accepted by my team and line managers and enjoy my work as much as possible.</p>
      <p id="Answers">My biggest dream or long-term goal is to be able to take care of my family financially and physically. My parents, when I grew up, they took care of me and supported me in lots of different ways to give me a good life. I want to pay them back, I want to take care of them and help whenever they need.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">A description of my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h2>
      <p id="Answers">I have many positive qualities and attributes, but I believe my main key strengths are:</p>
      <p id="Positive">-I have a hard-working nature;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-I have an excellent communication skill;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-I am always looking for the positives in every situation;</p>
      <p id="Positive">-I am a great team player.</p>
      <p id="Answers">One other quality is that I am always looking for ways to improve the way I perform so I can work to the highest standards possible in my role.</p>
      <p id="Answers">I believe all these qualities will help me get through well when it comes to learning. If I was to choose one quality, I would choose to look for positives in every situation and that will be the key to help me to learn as much as I could. I assume there will be some stress as I learn, and I think it is good to have a positive mindset so that I can try to look to find ways to resolve the issue as fast as possible.</p>
      <p id="Answers">I do struggle sometimes, and that is I sometimes get slightly irritated when I use a lot of my time to understand when I do not get the concept. Using a lot of time to understand something can be a good habit but it also means that I will get pressured and will not have a lot of time to finish my other work. Also, because I am a bit introverted and quiet most of the times, I like to be alone and do things by myself. This can cause a lot of problems, like for example, I might try solve the problem by myself even if it takes a lot of time, and might not be brave enough to ask questions to others. I think it will be good to raise a hand to someone for help but when I think about my personality, I am not the person who really does that and might cause some stress when it comes to learning.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would I like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">There are many human skills that workers need to thrive in today’s rapidly evolving organisations and the two most human skills that I want to see a development in myself are empathy and a growth mindset. I want to be able to and further develop myself to understand and share the feelings of one another. Most of the times, I rely on the fact and what the issue is but not looking at what the others are going through, what their thoughts are, and what feelings they have. In order to change my view, I would need to be mindful of others so when there is a problem, I will be able to understand and share my feelings as well as listening to theirs. With growth mindset, I did mention in my strengths part above that I want to keep improving myself and just adding to that, I want to continually think to myself that my position is not safe. I need to evolve and further train myself to learn more and I think that will lead to a solid growth mindset.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Time management and organisational skills are what I need in order to manage my workload in this programme. I would need to use my time well to plan out what I need to do now and in the future when things start building up and for me to be able to work productively. Using a calendar to write down what I need to do exactly for that week and trying to keep my time using the Toggl tool would be very important. I think it is also important to go over the topics for that week and see if I missed out on anything and to revise again for future use so that I fully understand before moving onto the next topic. It will be good to revise for the topics I will cover in the upcoming weeks just so that I have an idea what will come up and not be surprised when I get stuck.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
      <p id="Answers">It will be good to think ahead the appropriate tools I need to use when I need to seek for help, just so that I will not panic if something goes wrong. Tools could be for example, using the Dev Academy discord channel, Google, and YouTube. If I get stuck on something, I will try look for information online. I will do about 20 to 30 minutes of research, and if I am still confused after that, I will try ask people around in the discord channel.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">A description of what I expect from the Facilitation team.</h2>
      <p id="Answers">The facilitation team has been wonderful so far in my learning journey here at Dev Academy. There is nothing to add more but if I was to give my expectations from the team, it would be kindness and support. It will get intense and busier as we learn more, and it would great if the team could help me out whenever they can. The team has been very supportive already!</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when I am committed to other things.</h2>
      <p id="Answers">I have a dog called Charlie (a dachshund breed), and he recently got a surgery on his back because of a disc problem. Because he cannot walk yet, I need to take him out (physically hold him up and carry) when he needs to go out for toilet. It would probably take about few minutes.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">Te Whare Tapa Whā</h2>
      <p id="Answers">Te whare tapa whā is a model of health that represents health and wellbeing as a wharenui (meeting house) with four walls. Leading Māori health advocate, Sir Mason Durie developed the model in 1984.</p>
      <p id="Answers">The wharenui walls are made up of:</p>
      <p id="Positive">Taha tinana – physical wellbeing;</p>
      <p id="Positive">Taha hinengaro – mental wellbeing;</p>
      <p id="Positive">Taha whanāu – family, community, and social wellbeing;</p>
      <p id="Positive">Taha wairua – spiritual wellbeing.</p>
      <p id="Answers">The whenua (land) forms the foundation.</p>
