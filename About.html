    <h1 id="ABOUTME">ABOUT ME</h1>
    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p id="Intro">Hi everyone, my name is Scott Park. I was born in Korea, moved to New Zealand when I was 8 years old, and I am currently based in Auckland. I have graduated University of Auckland, majoring in Economics and Finance and worked as a finance team member in different companies.</p>
    <p id="Intro">The reason why I am attending Dev Academy is because I want to develop, learn new things so that I could find some improvements for myself and have a successful career. After doing some coding activities online, I really had the passion and desire to learn more coding. Also, after hearing stories from people that have already graduated here at Dev Academy and my friends who are already working as a developer after university, it really clicked into me that I also wanted to become a developer, and which I applied for and joined Dev Academy.</p>
    <p id="Intro">In my spare time, I love to play football with my friends, play games online, and watch movies.</p>
    <p id="Intro">Nice to meet you all!</p>
