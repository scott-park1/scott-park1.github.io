  <h1 id="ABOUTME">ABOUT ME</h1>
  <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p id="Intro">Hi everyone, my name is Scott Park. I was born in Korea, moved to New Zealand when I was 8 years old, and I am currently living in Auckland.</p>
  <p id="Intro">The reason why I am attending Dev Academy is because I want to develop, learn new things so that I could find some improvements for myself and have a successful career. In order to do that, and my short-term goal would be to study hard, learn as much as I could, and become a good developer. My biggest dream or long-term goal is to be able to take care of my family financially and physically.</p>
  <p id="Intro">Nice to meet you all!</p>
  <h3 id="Introduction">Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>
  <h4 id="AboutmeH">A situation where I have made an ethical decision. How I have weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision I made, and my reflection on the decision now.</h4>
  <p id="Intro">To my understand, an ethical decision is a decision that leads to fairness, trust, and honesty. I had a situation where my friend had a car crash that was caused by speeding and I was next to him. He was speeding downhill, the car skidded and bumped into a shop sign. We had to call the car tower and because we bumped into a shop sign, we had to call the police to resolve the issue. My friend did not want to mention that he speeded as it might cause him some trouble. I made an ethical decision here and with my values of kindness and caring, to politely and kindly asking him to tell the truth, which was best for him and a caring mind that I had for him. At the end of the day, things were resolved well and when I think about it now, I think I made the right decision for him which highlights the ethical values of fairness and honesty. I did not want him to suffer any pain from unethical thinking he made.</p>
  <h4 id="AboutmeH">How did my culture and the people around me have influenced my values and identity.</h4>
  <p id="Intro">My values and identity would be Kindness, Caring, and Respect. These values were slightly affected through my culture back since when I was young and the people around me. First, I was born in Korea and grew up there until 8 years old. Korean culture highlights the values of kindness and being respectful especially towards older people than you and when meeting for the first time. An example would be bowing when saying “Hi” to older people. This is the nature of it and because I follow the Korean ways a lot of the times, my values are really influenced by the values that Koreans follow.
    People are also part of the impact in which where my values came from. I have a lot of people around me and they are all kind and nice, try to take care of me, try to support me, and gives a lot of respect. When I see them, it really touches my heart to be like one of them, or to have a good personality like them.
    </p>
  <h4 id="AboutmeH">My strengths and how they will support me during my learning journey.</h4>
  <p id="Intro">I have many positive qualities and attributes, but I believe my main key strengths are:</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I have a hard-working nature;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I have an excellent communication skill;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I am adaptable;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I am always looking for the positives in every situation;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I am a great team player;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I like to support others;</p>
  <p id="Positive">-I am dependable.</p>
    <p id="Intro">One other quality is that I am always looking for ways to improve the way I perform so I can work to the highest standards possible in my role.
    I believe all these qualities will help me get through well during my learning journey here at Dev Academy. If I was to choose one quality, I would choose to look for positives in every situation and that will be the key to help me to get through the course smoothly. I assume there will be some stress as I learn, and I think it is good to be positive minded so that I can try to look to find ways to resolve the issue as fast as possible.
   </p>
   <h4 id="AboutmeH">My limitations in terms of my learning and career development. How might these affect my learning journey?</h4>
   <p id="Intro">I do struggle sometimes, and that is I sometimes get slightly irritated when I use a lot of my time to understand when I do not get the concept. Using a lot of time to understand something can be a good habit but it also means that I will get pressured and will not have a lot of time to finish my work to a high standard or at least up to the limit where I think it looks good. Also, because I am a bit introverted and quiet most of the times, I like to be alone and do things by myself. This can cause a lot of problems to my learning journey because there might be times that I will struggle when learning and might try solve the problem by myself. I think it will be good to raise a hand in the discord channel and even ask someone for help but when I think about my personality, I am not the person who really does that and might cause some stress when it comes to learning.</p>
   <p id="Intro">Having said that, I have been trying to turn this weakness into something positive by trying to be confident in every way. It will not be easy but I will try to get some support from others, and which I think it will help me a lot to get my way through the course smoothly.</p>
   <h4 id="AboutmeH">An example of when I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. What strategies I have tried at the time, how effective they were, and my reflections on what other strategies I would try now and why.</h4>
   <p id="Intro">Back when I was working as a finance team member, there were times where I had to interact with other team members for complete the work. Because we did not know each other the first time we met, there was some awkwardness and tension between us but not for long though. As we got to know each other a bit, we went out to have lunch and dinner with other team members. These sessions helped us to be more comfortable with each other and to build good relationship, which led us to work productively. Other strategies I would try is going for a team build challenges like escape rooms, and other team sports activities that includes some co-operation. These activities will help us get talking even if we do not want to, which will break the ice, and will help us to be more comfortable with each other and finish the work more efficiently.</p>
