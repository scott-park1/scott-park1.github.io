      <h1 id="Identity">My Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
      <h2 id="QuestionFirst">A situation where I have made an ethical decision. How I have weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision I made, and my reflection on the decision now.</h2>
      <p id="Answer">To my understand, an ethical decision is a decision that leads to fairness, trust, and honesty. I had a situation where my friend had a car crash that was caused by speeding and I was next to him. He was speeding downhill, the car skidded and bumped into a shop sign. We had to call the car tower and because we bumped into a shop sign, we had to call the police to resolve the issue. My friend did not want to mention that he speeded as it might cause him some trouble. I made an ethical decision here and with my values of kindness and caring, to politely and kindly asking him to tell the truth, which was best for him and a caring mind that I had for him. At the end of the day, things were resolved well and when I think about it now, I think I made the right decision for him which highlights the ethical values of fairness and honesty.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">How did my culture and the people around me have influenced my values and identity.</h2>
      <p id="Answer">My values and identity would be Kindness, Caring, and Respect. These values were slightly affected through my culture back when I was young and the people around me. First, I was born in Korea and grew up there until 8 years old. Korean culture highlights the values of kindness and being respectful especially towards older people than you and when meeting for the first time. An example would be bowing when saying “Hi” to older people. This is the nature of it and because I follow the Korean ways a lot of the times, my values are really influenced by the values that Koreans follow.</p>
      <p id="Answer">People are also part of the impact in which where my values came from. I have a lot of people around me and they are all kind and nice, try to take care of me, try to support me, and gives a lot of respect. When I see them, it really touches my heart to be like one of them, or to have a good personality like them.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">My strengths and how they will support me during my learning journey.</h2>
      <p id="Answer">I have used the strengths finder tool to seek through what sort of positive qualities I have and a few strengths I found were prudence, judgement, and teamwork. It really showed me what I think the most about and all these strengths I found out looked true. I am really careful about whatever decisions I make, I look back and examine what I have done, and I really am a team player who loves to work within the team and lead the team to success. In my learning journey here at Dev Academy, I can surely say that those strengths will help me get through the course smoothly. If I am not sure about a work I have done, I want to be very careful and just check what I have made, see if there are any mistakes before and also after submitting my work. Also, as we learn more, and if there are any team projects to do, I want to be fully committed and help the team to reach the end goal.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">My limitations in terms of my learning and career development. How might these affect my learning journey?</h2>
      <p id="Answer">My limitation would be the lesser strength I have, and which I found out using the strength finder tool as well. One and the biggest weakness I found was bravery. I tend to shrink from a challenge and any difficulties. I think this is somewhat correct as I get a bit stressed and annoyed when things do not turn out the way I think it would be. I guess as we learn more, there will be more coding work to do and if something does not work, I will probably need a bit of help, both emotionally and actual physical help from others to try cover my weakness.</p>
      <h2 id="Question">An example of when I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. What strategies I have tried at the time, how effective they were, and my reflections on what other strategies I would try now and why.</h2>
      <p id="AnswerLast">Back when I was working as a finance team member, there were times where I had to interact with other team members to complete the work. The first time we met, there was some awkwardness and tension between us but not for long though. As we got to know each other a bit, we went out to have lunch and dinner with other team members. These sessions helped us to be more comfortable with each other and to build good relationship, which led us to work productively. Other strategies I would try is going for a team build challenges like escape rooms, and other team sports activities that includes some co-operation. These activities will help us get talking even if we do not want to, which will break the ice, and will help us to be more comfortable with each other and finish the work more efficiently.</p>
