      <h1 id="Learning">Problem Solving</h1>
      <h2 id="QuestionsFirst">A time when I was blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">A lot of the time I was blocked on a simple problem, for example, spelling mistake, case mistake, and using different notation at times. When I faced these problems, I first read carefully through all my work from the start and to the end, I tried to read error messages, I tried the rubber ducky method by reading out loud what I wrote and tried to find the issue. Some were able to be found but when it was not the case, I got the coaches to help. I was really frustrated at the time when I stuck and when I got to the answer, I was mad that I made the easiest mistake. I learned to carefully code and to be focused when using different kinds of JavaScript methods.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">A time when I elegantly solved a problem?</h2>
      <p id="Answers">For me personally, JavaScript Kata exercises were difficult for some of the questions. I was really stuck for long period of time trying to solve one question. Most of the time I was in panic because I really wanted to solve the question, I thought I did everything right but I kept getting the wrong answer. On top of the techniques I used above, I also used a lot of Google and YouTube to search for what I need to do, and #tech-questions discord channel was really useful as well. I learned that all these techniques really helped me to get to the answer and I would probably use a lot during my learning journey here at Dev Academy.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">How confident I am with using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes?</h2>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Pseudocode</b>: Pseudocode really helped me to organise what I was going to add, how the code should be written, and using it like a checklist to see if I have added everything correctly. I am confident using Pseudocode as I used a lot during my JavaScript Method and JavaScript Kata challenges.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Trying something</b>: When I was stuck for a long time, I tried to write a code in some other way and just comment out the original one that I wrote. It worked for some times but when it was not the case, I tried to look again the original piece and tried to resolve it from there again. I am not too confident using this method because I usually like to stick to one way or the way I learned previously.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Rubber ducky method</b>: This method really helped me when I faced issues. It is true that if you read out loud you can spot the mistake sometimes. I am really confident using this method.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Reading error messages</b>: Reading error messages after running the test helped me to find where the mistakes were but sometimes, when I look at the issue, I still would not know how to resolve the problem. I can say that I am half confident using this method.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Console.logging</b>: I have not used console.log that often when I was completing my exercises. Rather, I only checked then answers when I was running the tests. I would need more practice on using console.log. I do not think I was that confident where to put the console.log and what goes inside it.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Googling</b>: Google is far most important tool when it comes to coding. I used it a lot when I was working on my exercises, when I did not know how to use some properties or methods.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Asking my peers for help</b>: Peers are important when it comes to learning. I have been asking questions to peers when I needed help and everyone was really kind and gave me some insights as to how a code must be written.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Asking coaches for help</b>: Coaches are also very important and I would not have finished my sprints without them. David helped me out so many times throughout the whole course so far, even if the questions were simple.</p>
      <p id="Answers"><b>Improving my process with reflection</b>: Self-reflection really helped me to look back what I did wrong, the steps I need to follow, what to watch out for, and was able to fix the problems in the future.</p>
      <h2 id="Questions">Reflect on a time when I was reluctant to ask for help. What made me reluctant to do so?</h2>
      <p id="AnswersLast">There were many times that I was stuck on a question and I really wanted to ask for help. I think I was not brave enough to ask a question that nobody asked in the discord channel, which made me feel dumb. I always think “What if someone laughs at my question?” Or “Why can’t he solve that question? It’s so easy!” I think it comes from my personality after all, that I always think what would others think about me if I made some kind of decision.</p>
